Hey!

This is a personal project thats meant to fill my time over Summer 2021, and help me practice my C# skills.
This was originally a friend's 6th form project that I'm building off of, and the fantastic main character is his!

I don't have a specific goal for this project, but I'll be releasing it on itch.io for fun

tldr; Summer 2021 personal project using Julius' old assets.
